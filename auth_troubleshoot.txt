# Authentication Troubleshooting Log

## Current Authentication Flow

1. Login Process:
   - User submits credentials to /api/auth/gridgate
   - Server validates against ADMINUSER and GRIDGATEKEY
   - On success: Creates JWT token and sets gridgate_token cookie
   - Expected: Redirect to /welcome page
   - Current Issue: No automatic redirect after successful login

2. Session Management:
   - Token stored in HTTP-only cookie (gridgate_token)
   - Token contains: username
   - Token expiration: 24 hours
   - Session state: isAuthenticated (boolean)

3. Protected Routes:
   - /posts/new
   - /posts/edit
   - /dashboard
   - /api/posts
   - /welcome

4. Public Routes:
   - /
   - /posts
   - /about
   - /search
   - /api/search
   - /api/posts/public
   - /api/auth/gridgate
   - /api/auth/logout
   - /api/auth/user
   - /gridgate

## Current Issues

1. Authentication Success but No Redirect:
   - Problem: After successful login, user is not automatically redirected to /welcome
   - Location: GridGate authentication flow
   - Expected Behavior: Redirect to /welcome after successful login
   - Current Behavior: Stays on login page despite successful authentication

2. Middleware Configuration:
   - Current matcher config may be too restrictive
   - Need to verify all protected routes are properly matched
   - Need to ensure proper handling of authentication state

## Debug Points

1. GridGate Authentication (/api/auth/gridgate):
   - Check if token is being set correctly
   - Verify cookie attributes (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
   - Confirm response includes isAuthenticated: true

2. Session Verification (/api/auth/user):
   - Verify token is being read from cookies
   - Check if session state is being returned correctly
   - Confirm isAuthenticated state is accurate

3. Middleware:
   - Verify token verification logic
   - Check route matching patterns
   - Confirm redirect logic for protected routes

## Next Steps

1. Add client-side redirect after successful login
2. Review middleware matcher configuration
3. Add more detailed logging for authentication flow
4. Test session persistence across page refreshes
5. Verify protected route access with valid token

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Login with valid credentials
- [x] Verify token is set in cookies
- [ ] Check automatic redirect to /welcome
- [ ] Test protected route access
- [ ] Verify session persistence
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Confirm public route access without authentication

## Change History

### [2024-03-19 15:30] - GridGate Login Page Fix
- Identified issue: Hardcoded localhost URL and complex response handling
- Changes made:
  1. Removed hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` URL
  2. Simplified response handling:
     - Direct JSON parsing
     - Explicit check for `isAuthenticated` flag
     - Cleaner error handling
  3. Removed unnecessary response validation complexity
  4. Cleaned up UI markup
- Expected outcome:
  1. Proper API request to relative URL
  2. Correct handling of authentication response
  3. Successful redirect to /welcome on authentication
- Status: Implemented, needs testing

### [2024-03-19 15:45] - Initial Testing Results
- Testing performed:
  1. Login with valid credentials: ✅ SUCCESS
     - Credentials accepted
     - Server responds with 200 status
     - Response includes isAuthenticated: true
  2. Token verification: ✅ SUCCESS
     - gridgate_token cookie is set
     - Cookie has correct attributes (httpOnly, path, etc.)
  3. Redirect to /welcome: ❌ FAILED
     - Authentication succeeds but redirect not triggering
     - Need to investigate router.push behavior
- Next steps:
  1. Add debug logging for router.push
  2. Verify router instance is properly initialized
  3. Consider using router.replace instead of push
  4. Add loading state feedback during redirect

[2024-03-19 15:30] RESOLUTION: Authentication Issue Fixed
Problem: Authentication response missing isAuthenticated field
Root Cause: Conflicting routes between custom server.js and Next.js API route
Solution: 
1. Removed custom server.js to eliminate route conflict
2. Using Next.js API route at src/app/api/auth/gridgate/route.ts
3. Response now includes required fields:
   {
     success: true,
     message: "Authentication successful",
     isAuthenticated: true
   }

Implementation Details:
- Next.js API route handles authentication
- Proper error handling for all cases
- Consistent response format
- Cookie-based session management
- Detailed logging for debugging

Next Steps:
1. Restart the Next.js development server
2. Test authentication flow
3. Monitor logs for any issues
